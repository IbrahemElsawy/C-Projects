#include <stdio.h> // It provides the input/output facilities in the C program.

int main(void) // The main () is to start the function of the program.

{ // This is to start the body of the program.

	printf("*** Welcome to C Programming ***\n"); //This function is to print a string that says, "*** Welcome to C Programming ***."

	printf("\n"); // This is to create a new line that is blank so it is easier to see the above printed string and the below printed string.

	printf("Press any key to exit the program: \n"); // This function is to print a string  saying, "Press any key to exit the program:."

	return (0); // This is to return the codes back to the operating system (OS).

} // This is used to end the body of the program.
